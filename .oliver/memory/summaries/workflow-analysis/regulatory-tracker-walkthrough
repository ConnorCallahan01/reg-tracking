## Key Points

- Regulatory Tracker is an AI-powered compliance platform combining Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Claude AI analysis, and SQLite database to automate regulatory monitoring and compliance analysis
- The system orchestrates a 7-stage pipeline: Initializing → Retrieving Sources → Detecting Changes → Analyzing (AI) → Scoring → Generating Artifacts → Finalizing
- Users initiate scans by selecting regulatory domain, jurisdiction, and sub-domains; the backend runs asynchronously while Claude AI analyzes detected changes for relevance, impact level, and recommended actions
- Results flow through a formal workflow (Draft → In Review → Verified) ensuring governance and proper review before items are added to the searchable Knowledge Store
- System automatically generates professional Word documents and markdown artifacts for each regulatory change, eliminating manual report creation and reducing compliance team workload by 70-80%

## Entities and Topics

- **ScanOrchestrator**: Central coordinator managing the 7-stage pipeline, state transitions, error handling, and real-time status updates
- **ChangeDetectionService**: Identifies material regulatory changes using SHA-256 content hashing, regex-based keyword detection, and demo mode for testing
- **LLMService**: Integrates with Claude API (claude-sonnet-4-20250514 model) to analyze regulatory content and produce structured JSON output with impact assessment
- **ArtifactGenerator**: Creates professional Markdown and Word documents (.docx) with metadata, summaries, and formatting for compliance documentation
- **Claude AI**: Performs intelligent analysis determining regulatory change validity, domain relevance, impact level (Low/Medium/High/Critical), confidence scores, and human review flags
- **Mock Regulatory Sources**: Four JSON files representing realistic documents (FinCEN CDD Amendment, FinCEN SAR Advisory, OCC Transaction Monitoring Guidance, Federal Reserve AML Procedures)
- **Workflow System**: Multi-stage review process (Draft/In Review/Verified) tracking regulatory changes through governance and verification stages
- **Knowledge Store**: Searchable archive of verified regulatory changes with filtering by impact level, date range, domain, and jurisdiction
